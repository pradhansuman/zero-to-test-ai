A production-grade, multi-agent QA framework that takes a GitHub issue and delivers a complete, executed, self-healing Playwright test suite — with zero human intervention in between.

```
GitHub Issue ──▶ Ingestor ──▶ Test Designer ──▶ Generator ──▶ Reviewer ──▶ Runner ──▶ Healer ──▶ Reporter
                  (API)        (formal BVA/EP)    (LLM)       (LLM critic)  (PW CLI)   (LLM)      (rule gate)
```

## Features

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **7-agent pipeline** | Ingestor → Test Designer → Generator → Reviewer → Runner → Healer → Reporter |
| **Iterative critic loop** | Reviewer audits generated suite; if verdict is "revise/reject", Generator gets one refinement pass with `top_3_fixes` injected |
| **Self-healing locators** | Detects selector drift, repairs via LLM grounded in live DOM, re-runs patched test. Never heals assertion failures |
| **Richer failure classification** | `LOCATOR` · `ASSERTION` · `ENVIRONMENT` · `FLAKY` · `TIMEOUT` · `OTHER` — rule-based, auditable, no LLM |
| **Visual regression** | 14 `toHaveScreenshot()` tests with 2% pixel tolerance + committed PNG baselines |
| **Multi-browser** | Desktop Chrome · Desktop Firefox · Mobile Chrome (Pixel 7) · Mobile Safari (iPhone 14, CI only — requires macOS 14+ or Docker) |
| **Full test pyramid** | 9 suites: API, performance, CWV, security, accessibility, endurance, state/resilience, error/edge-cases, visual + k6 load |
| **Dynamic test prioritization** | `git diff` → grep pattern; cuts CI from ~8 min to < 2 min on minor changes |
| **MCP server** | Real stdio JSON-RPC server — register in Claude desktop to control the pipeline via natural language |
| **Rule-based gate** | `ReporterAgent._gate()`: any P0 fail or pass rate < 90% → FAIL. LLM writes the narrative, never makes the decision |

## What You Can Achieve

### 1. Zero-Touch QA from a GitHub Issue
Point it at any public repo and issue number — the pipeline ingests, plans, generates runnable Playwright tests, executes them, repairs broken selectors, and delivers a pass/fail gate with a written report. No human writes a single line of test code.

```bash
python -m orchestrator.pipeline facebook/react 28000 --token ghp_xxx --real
```

### 2. Formal Test Design at Scale
Switch `--sdet` on and the `TestDesignerAgent` applies Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, Decision Tables, Pairwise, and Error Guessing — derived automatically from acceptance criteria in seconds.

### 3. Self-Healing Test Maintenance
When the UI changes and a selector breaks, the `HealerAgent` detects it (locator failure, not assertion), consults the live DOM, asks Claude for a repaired selector, patches the file, and re-runs. The old→new selector and confidence score are logged for human audit. Broken builds due to CSS class renames or `data-testid` changes become automatic fixes.

### 4. Production-Grade Test Pyramid on a Live App
The math hub proves the framework works against a real deployed SPA — 196 golden E2E tests across 2 browsers (Desktop Chrome + Mobile Chrome), 19 HTTP/API contract tests, 16 performance tests (TTFB, in-browser widget timing), 17 security tests (no eval, XSS guards, storage leakage), 12 endurance loop tests (30-iteration accuracy drift, 50-click idempotency), 14 visual regression tests with pixel diff baselines, and a full k6 load test suite with 5 scenarios up to 200 VUs. The ShopNow store adds a second complete pyramid: 286 tests across 9 suites (API, CWV, performance, security, accessibility, endurance, state/resilience, error/edge-cases, visual) with 3 browser targets — including 12 negative-path tests that catch real bugs like unguarded unknown product IDs causing NaN totals.

### 5. CI That Gets Smarter on Each PR
The prioritization script reads the git diff and tells CI exactly which test groups are at risk — if you only touched `math-hub-perf.spec.ts`, only the performance suite runs. A full 600+ test run becomes a targeted 30-test run on minor changes, without ever skipping something that could actually break.

### 6. Control the Entire QA Pipeline via Natural Language
Register `mcp_server/server.py` in Claude desktop and say: *"Run the security tests on Mobile Chrome and explain any failures"* — the MCP tools execute Playwright, parse results, classify each failure with rationale and next action, and return structured JSON, all without leaving the chat.

### 7. PRD → Tests → Jira → Slack → GitHub PR (Full Enterprise Loop)
The `mcp_framework/` extends the core pipeline: ingest a PRD, generate and scaffold a Playwright project on disk, execute it, file Jira tickets for genuine failures, open a GitHub PR with the test code, and post a Slack notification with the gate result.

### 8. Multi-Agent Deliberation on Any Question
`council.py` is a standalone 5-agent debate system — independent of the QA pipeline. It is useful for any structured decision-making, risk analysis, or architectural review where you want multiple AI perspectives pressure-tested by a Safety Guard before converging on a synthesised answer.

## CI/CD — What Runs Automatically (GitHub Actions)

| Trigger | Job | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Every push | `playwright` | Full Playwright suite → publishes Allure report to GitHub Pages |
| Every push | `pipeline-smoke` | AI pipeline smoke run (offline demo mode, no API key) |
| Every push | `summary` | Gate decision (`PASS`/`FAIL`) surfaced as job output; `exit 1` on FAIL |
| `issues: [labeled]` with `qa-ready` | `qa-pipeline` | Full 7-agent pipeline against the labeled issue |
| Weekly (Mon 6am UTC) | `mutation` | `mutmut run` — mutation testing score |
| Every push | `security` | `npm audit` + `pip-audit` — dependency vulnerability scan |

The gate decision is **always rule-based code**, never an LLM call:
- Any P0 failure → `FAIL`
- Pass rate < 90% → `FAIL`
- Otherwise → `PASS`

## 🚀 Getting Started — Run It Yourself

There are three ways to use this framework depending on what you want to do.

---

### ▶ Option A — Run the existing test suite (no API key needed)

The fastest way to see everything working. Runs 286 tests against the ShopNow demo store.

**Step 1 — Install dependencies**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pradhansuman/zero-to-test-ai.git
cd zero-to-test-ai

pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
npx playwright install chromium firefox
```

**Step 2 — Run the full suite**
```bash
./run-tests.sh
```

**What you'll see:**
```
🧪 ShopNow QA Pipeline
▶  Running full suite (playwright.store.config.ts)…
   Running 286 tests using 4 workers
   ...
▶  Running Python unit tests…
   88 passed in 2.77s
▶  Generating HTML report…
   Gate: PASS  |  285/286 passed  |  3.0m 23.0s
✓  Report written → store-qa-report.html
```

**Step 3 — Open the report**
```bash
open store-qa-report.html                        # custom dashboard
npx playwright show-report playwright-report-store  # playwright's built-in report
```

**Other useful commands:**
```bash
./run-tests.sh --smoke                           # fast smoke gate (~11s, 13 tests)
npx playwright test tests/e2e/store-security.spec.ts --config playwright.store.config.ts  # single suite
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v                  # unit tests only
```

---

### ▶ Option B — Run the AI pipeline on a GitHub issue

The pipeline reads a real GitHub issue, designs tests, generates Playwright code, runs it, self-heals broken selectors, and delivers a PASS/FAIL report — zero manual test writing.

**Step 1 — Install dependencies** (same as Option A above)

**Step 2 — Try it offline first (no API key, no internet)**
```bash
python -m orchestrator.pipeline --demo --offline
```

Expected output:
```
[ ingested] ok   [ planned] ok   [generated] ok
[  tested] ok   [  healed] ok   [ reported] ok

Issue #1042: Login form allows empty email submission
Run:  5/5 passed (100.0%)
Heal: 1 recovered  TC-002: [data-testid="submit-btn"] → [data-testid="login-submit"] (conf 0.93)
Gate: PASS
```

**Step 3 — Run against a real GitHub issue**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...          # get from console.anthropic.com
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx                  # optional — avoids rate limits

python -m orchestrator.pipeline facebook/react 28000 --token ghp_xxx
```

**Step 4 — Run with real Playwright browser execution**
```bash
python -m orchestrator.pipeline myorg/myapp 42 --token ghp_xxx --real
```

**Optional flags:**
```bash
--sdet        # use formal test design (BVA, Equivalence Partitioning, Pairwise)
--no-review   # skip the Reviewer audit (saves one LLM call)
--demo        # use canned LLM responses (still hits GitHub, no API credits)
```

---

### ▶ Option C — Test your own application

Use this framework to build a full test pyramid for any web app you own.

**Step 1 — Install dependencies** (same as Option A above)

**Step 2 — Create a Playwright config for your app**
```bash
cp playwright.store.config.ts playwright.myapp.config.ts
```

Edit `playwright.myapp.config.ts`:
```typescript
// Change the testMatch to target your new spec files
testMatch: ['myapp-*.spec.ts'],

// Change baseURL to your app
use: {
  baseURL: 'https://myapp.com',   // or file:// for a local HTML file
}
```

**Step 3 — Create test suites in `tests/e2e/`**

Copy a store suite as your starting template and adapt the selectors:
```bash
cp tests/e2e/store-api.spec.ts      tests/e2e/myapp-api.spec.ts
cp tests/e2e/store-security.spec.ts tests/e2e/myapp-security.spec.ts
cp tests/e2e/store-a11y.spec.ts     tests/e2e/myapp-a11y.spec.ts
cp tests/e2e/store-cwv.spec.ts      tests/e2e/myapp-cwv.spec.ts
cp tests/e2e/store-perf.spec.ts     tests/e2e/myapp-perf.spec.ts
cp tests/e2e/store-error.spec.ts    tests/e2e/myapp-error.spec.ts
cp tests/e2e/store-loop.spec.ts     tests/e2e/myapp-loop.spec.ts
cp tests/e2e/store-visual.spec.ts   tests/e2e/myapp-visual.spec.ts
```

Then edit each file — update the `URL`, selectors, product data, and assertions to match your app.

**Step 4 — Register your suites in the HTML report**

In `scripts/generate_html_report.py`, add your suites to `SUITE_META`:
```python
SUITE_META = {
    ...
    'myapp-api':      {'label': 'Contract / API',  'icon': '📋', 'color': '#6366f1'},
    'myapp-security': {'label': 'Security',        'icon': '🔒', 'color': '#f59e0b'},
    'myapp-a11y':     {'label': 'Accessibility',   'icon': '♿', 'color': '#8b5cf6'},
    'myapp-perf':     {'label': 'Performance',     'icon': '⚡', 'color': '#0ea5e9'},
    'myapp-cwv':      {'label': 'Core Web Vitals', 'icon': '📊', 'color': '#10b981'},
    'myapp-error':    {'label': 'Error / Edge',    'icon': '⚠️', 'color': '#e11d48'},
    'myapp-loop':     {'label': 'Endurance',       'icon': '🔁', 'color': '#f97316'},
    'myapp-visual':   {'label': 'Visual',          'icon': '👁', 'color': '#a855f7'},
}
```

**Step 5 — Generate visual baselines on first run**
```bash
npx playwright test tests/e2e/myapp-visual.spec.ts \
  --config playwright.myapp.config.ts --update-snapshots
```

**Step 6 — Run and check**
```bash
npx playwright test --config playwright.myapp.config.ts
```

---

### Which option should I pick?

| Your situation | Option |
|---|---|
| Just want to see the framework in action | **A** — run the store suite |
| Have a GitHub issue and want auto-generated tests | **B** — AI pipeline |
| Want to test your own web app | **C** — manual suites |
| No API key, no internet, just exploring | **A** or **B** with `--demo --offline` |
| Want AI to generate a starting point, then refine manually | **B** first, then adapt the output as **C** |

---

## Math Hub Test Suite (CBSE Class 8)

A complete test pyramid against a live GitHub Pages SPA — all suites run in CI.

### Run all suites

```bash
# Full pyramid — Desktop Chrome + Mobile Chrome
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts

# Single suite
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts tests/e2e/math-hub-api.spec.ts

# Headed (browser window visible)
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts --headed
```

### Test pyramid

| Suite | File | Tests | What it validates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Golden E2E** | `math-hub.spec.golden.ts` | 98 × 2 browsers | All 16 chapters, MCQ engine, widgets, navigation (Desktop Chrome + Mobile Chrome) |
| **API / HTTP** | `math-hub-api.spec.ts` | 19 | Status codes, HTTPS/HSTS, ETag caching, self-containment |
| **Performance** | `math-hub-perf.spec.ts` | 16 | TTFB < 3s, widget latency < 50ms (in-browser), DOM complexity |
| **Security** | `math-hub-security.spec.ts` | 17 | No eval(), textContent vs innerHTML, no storage leakage |
| **Endurance loops** | `math-hub-loop.spec.ts` | 12 | 30-iter accuracy, 50-click idempotency, 30× canvas redraw |
| **Visual regression** | `math-hub-visual.spec.ts` | 14 | Screenshot diff, canvas charts, MCQ states, mobile layout |
| **Load (k6)** | `tests/load/math-hub.k6.js` | — | CDN p95 < 27ms, 0% error, 50% ETag cache hit |

### Visual regression baselines

Baselines are committed in `tests/e2e/__snapshots__/`. To regenerate after intentional UI changes:

```bash
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts \
  tests/e2e/math-hub-visual.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

### Load testing with k6

```bash
k6 run tests/load/math-hub.k6.js                         # smoke:  5 VUs / 20s
k6 run --env SCENARIO=steady tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # steady: 50 VUs / 60s hold
k6 run --env SCENARIO=spike  tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # spike:  burst to 100 VUs
k6 run --env SCENARIO=stress tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # stress: ramp to 200 VUs
k6 run --env SCENARIO=soak   tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # soak:   20 VUs / 10 min
```

### Dynamic test prioritization

Run only the tests at risk from your current diff — cuts CI time on minor PRs:

```bash
# Compute grep pattern from current diff and run
GREP=$(python scripts/prioritize_tests.py)
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts --grep "$GREP"

# Full JSON report showing which rules fired and why
python scripts/prioritize_tests.py --json
```

---

## ShopNow Store Test Suite

A full test pyramid for the dark-mode e-commerce SPA (`store.html`) — applies all advanced QA techniques to a real interactive application with localStorage persistence, cart sidebar, quantity controls, checkout, and toast notifications.

### Run all store suites

```bash
# Recommended: full pipeline — runs all tests, generates HTML report, auto-commits results
./run-tests.sh

# Smoke tests only (fast, ~11s — @smoke-tagged tests across all suites)
./run-tests.sh --smoke

# Raw Playwright — full pyramid, Desktop Chrome + Desktop Firefox + Mobile Chrome
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts

# Single suite
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts tests/e2e/store-error.spec.ts

# Headed (browser window visible)
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts --headed
```

### Store test pyramid

286 tests across 9 suites, 3 browser targets (Desktop Chrome · Desktop Firefox · Mobile Chrome).
Mobile Safari (iPhone 14) runs in CI only — Playwright WebKit requires macOS 14+ or the CI Playwright Docker image.

| Suite | File | Tests | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Contract / API** | `store-api.spec.ts` | 12 | Product schema, DOM contracts, localStorage interface |
| **Performance** | `store-perf.spec.ts` | 10 | JS execution speed, DOM size, Navigation Timing API |
| **Core Web Vitals** | `store-cwv.spec.ts` | 8 | Google CWV metrics: FCP, DCL, CLS, TBT, load timing |
| **Security** | `store-security.spec.ts` | 12 | No eval(), XSS guards, localStorage hygiene, self-containment |
| **Accessibility** | `store-a11y.spec.ts` | 12 | WCAG 2.1 AA: axe-core scan, keyboard nav, ARIA, focus trap |
| **Endurance loops** | `store-loop.spec.ts` | 12 | 30-cycle accuracy, 50-toggle CSS stability, full lifecycle |
| **State & Resilience** | `store-network.spec.ts` | 8 | localStorage persistence, context isolation, corrupted-data recovery |
| **Error / Edge Cases** | `store-error.spec.ts` | 12 | Invalid IDs, boundary qty, double-checkout, NaN guards |
| **Visual regression** | `store-visual.spec.ts` | 14 | Screenshot diffs (2% tolerance), cart states, mobile layout |
| **Load (k6)** | `tests/load/store.k6.js` | — | 4 scenarios (smoke/steady/spike/stress), p95 < 500ms |

---

### Suite details

#### 1. Contract / API — `store-api.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Validates the structural contract of the app — if any of these fail, the entire store is broken for all users.

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| API-01 `@smoke` | Page loads and product grid is visible |
| API-02 | All 10 products have name, price, emoji, description in the DOM |
| API-03 | Every product has a unique `data-product-id` attribute |
| API-04 `@smoke` | Exactly 10 product cards rendered — no duplicates, no missing |
| API-05 | All `data-testid` selectors are present and unique |
| API-06 | Product prices match the PRODUCTS array values in the DOM |
| API-07 | All Add-to-Cart buttons are enabled on initial load |
| API-08 `@smoke` | Cart initialises empty in a fresh browser context |
| API-09 | localStorage key `shopnow-cart` is written after adding items |
| API-10 | localStorage schema is a valid `{id: qty}` object |
| API-11 | Total of all 10 products matches expected sum ($545.85) |
| API-12 | Cart count badge always matches actual number of items in cart |

---

#### 2. Performance — `store-perf.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Measures JavaScript execution speed inside the browser using `performance.now()` — not wall-clock time — so Playwright RPC overhead doesn't inflate the numbers.

| Test | Threshold | What it measures |
|---|---|---|
| PERF-01 `@smoke` | < 50ms | `renderProducts()` — building all 10 cards from scratch |
| PERF-02 | < 25ms | `addToCart()` after JIT warm-up — steady-state speed |
| PERF-03 | < 20ms | `updateCartUI()` with a full 10-item cart |
| PERF-04 `@smoke` | < 500ms | Adding all 10 products in a loop |
| PERF-05 | < 5ms | `localStorage.setItem()` write speed |
| PERF-06 | < 400 nodes | Total DOM node count with cart open (complexity guard) |
| PERF-07 | < 25ms | `updateCartUI()` on a 10-item × 3-qty cart |
| PERF-08 | < 5ms | `showToast()` — toast display trigger |
| PERF-09 | < 50ms | `removeItem()` on a full 10-item cart |
| PERF-10 | < 3000ms | Navigation Timing API: all 10 cards visible after page load |

---

#### 3. Core Web Vitals — `store-cwv.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Google's official user-experience metrics — the same signals Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights report. Poor CWV scores affect Google search ranking.

| Test | Metric | Threshold | What it measures |
|---|---|---|---|
| CWV-01 `@smoke` | **FCP** — First Contentful Paint | < 3000ms | How fast the first pixel appears |
| CWV-02 | **DCL** — DOM Content Loaded | < 3000ms | How fast HTML is parsed and ready |
| CWV-03 | **CLS** — Cumulative Layout Shift (interaction) | < 0.5 | Elements jumping during add-to-cart + cart open/close |
| CWV-04 | Load event | < 3000ms | All 10 cards visible after full page load |
| CWV-05 | CLS on add-to-cart | < 0.1 | Adding 10 items causes no layout shifts |
| CWV-06 | **TBT** — Total Blocking Time | < 200ms | Scripts that freeze the UI > 50ms |
| CWV-07 | Navigation wall-clock | < 5000ms | End-to-end load time as the user experiences it |
| CWV-08 | CLS on cart animation | < 0.1 | Cart slide-in/out doesn't shift page content |

> **Design note:** CWV-03 deliberately omits `buffered: true` in the PerformanceObserver. That flag replays page-load layout shifts during an interaction-only test, causing false positives. Only shifts triggered by user actions are measured.

---

#### 4. Security — `store-security.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Ensures the store cannot be used as an XSS attack vector and that sensitive data is not leaked through localStorage or external requests.

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| SEC-01 `@smoke` | No `eval()` call exists anywhere in the page JavaScript |
| SEC-02 | Product names use `textContent`, never `innerHTML` (XSS guard) |
| SEC-03 | No `document.write()` calls — classic injection vector |
| SEC-04 | Cart data in localStorage contains only numeric IDs and quantities |
| SEC-05 | Injecting `<script>alert(1)</script>` as a product name is rendered as text |
| SEC-06 | No sensitive keys (`password`, `token`, `secret`) stored in localStorage |
| SEC-07 `@smoke` | No external network requests made (page is fully self-contained) |
| SEC-08 | Cart IDs are integers — no prototype pollution via string keys |
| SEC-09 | Product names rendered in cart contain no script tags |
| SEC-10 | Cart item HTML contains no injected script markup |
| SEC-11 | No external `<script>` or `<link>` tags loaded from outside the file |
| SEC-12 | Cart count badge always shows a non-negative integer |

---

#### 5. Accessibility — `store-a11y.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance — the legal standard for web accessibility (required by ADA in the US, EN 301 549 in the EU). Covers both automated scanning and manual interaction tests that tools cannot automate.

| Test | What it checks |
|---|---|
| AX-01 `@smoke` | Automated axe-core scan on page load — catches ~57% of WCAG violations |
| AX-02 | Colour contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 on buttons (`#2563eb` blue, `#166534` green) |
| AX-03 | Keyboard Tab navigation reaches the cart button (keyboard-only users) |
| AX-04 | Cart items list has `role="list"` so screen readers announce item count |
| AX-05 | `aria-label` on cart button updates live as items are added/removed |
| AX-06 | Toast uses `aria-live="polite"` — screen readers announce "Item added" |
| AX-07 | Cart sidebar has `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` |
| AX-08 | Checkout button uses native `disabled` (correct — no ARIA workaround) |
| AX-09 | Product emoji thumbnails have text equivalents in the DOM |
| AX-10 | Full axe-core scan after items added to cart (state-aware re-scan) |
| AX-11 | Opening cart moves focus to Close button (focus trap for keyboard users) |
| AX-12 | Product grid has `aria-label`; all Add-to-Cart buttons are individually labelled |

> **Why axe-core alone is not enough:** Automated tools catch structural violations but cannot test keyboard focus order, live region announcements, or focus trap behaviour. AX-03, AX-05, AX-06, and AX-11 are manual assertion tests for exactly this reason.

---

#### 6. Endurance Loops — `store-loop.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Runs the same operations hundreds of times in a loop to expose accuracy drift, memory leaks, CSS corruption, and idempotency failures that only appear after repeated use.

| Test | Loop count | What it watches for |
|---|---|---|
| LOOP-01 | 30 cycles | Add/remove all 10 products — total always returns to $0.00 |
| LOOP-02 | 50 clicks | `toggleCart()` — no CSS class corruption after rapid open/close |
| LOOP-03 | 30 cycles | `addToCart()` for one product — quantity accumulates correctly |
| LOOP-04 | 30 cycles | `removeItem()` — cart always ends at 0 items and $0.00 |
| LOOP-05 | 30 cycles | `checkout()` — cart clears correctly every time |
| LOOP-06 | 30 cycles | `changeQty(+1)` — quantity increments without drift |
| LOOP-07 | 30 cycles | `changeQty(-1)` — item removed exactly when qty hits 0 |
| LOOP-08 | 50 clicks | Button state — "Add to Cart" / "Added!" toggle, no stuck states |
| LOOP-09 | 30 cycles | Toast appears and disappears correctly every time |
| LOOP-10 `@smoke` | 1 pass | All 10 products added once — total equals $545.85 exactly |
| LOOP-11 | 50 toggles | Cart CSS class stable — ends in correct open/closed state |
| LOOP-12 | 3 full cycles | Add all → clear cart → repeat — cart fully reusable |

---

#### 7. State & Resilience — `store-network.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Verifies cart state durability under unexpected conditions — reloads, multiple tabs, corrupted storage. Answers the question: "Does the app hold together when things go wrong?"

| Test | Scenario | What could break |
|---|---|---|
| NET-01 `@smoke` | Add items → reload → cart still present | localStorage not written or read on wrong key |
| NET-02 | Same store in 2 separate browser contexts | Cross-context state leaking or colliding |
| NET-03 | Corrupt localStorage with `{"x":"broken"}` → reload | App crashes instead of resetting gracefully |
| NET-04 | Set localStorage to invalid JSON → reload | `JSON.parse()` throws, app never initialises |
| NET-05 | Call `addToCart()` 10× in rapid succession | Race condition corrupts quantity or total |
| NET-06 | Cart total matches expected value after reload | Floating-point math breaks across serialise/deserialise |
| NET-07 | Remove all items → localStorage entry cleared | Stale key left behind; next session loads ghost items |
| NET-08 | Manually delete localStorage → reload | App panics vs. starting fresh cleanly |

---

#### 8. Error / Edge Cases — `store-error.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Tests every guard condition and defensive code path — the scenarios the happy-path suite deliberately skips. These tests exist because two real bugs were found (and fixed) while writing them.

| Test | Input | Expected behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| ERR-01 `@smoke` | `addToCart(999)` — unknown ID | No-op; cart stays at 0; no crash |
| ERR-02 | `removeItem(99)` — ID never added | No-op; existing items unaffected |
| ERR-03 | Double `removeItem()` on same ID | Second call is safe; no key-not-found error |
| ERR-04 | `changeQty(999, +1)` — unknown ID | No NaN in total; cart stays at $0.00 |
| ERR-05 | `changeQty(id, -100)` — massive decrement | Item removed; qty never goes negative |
| ERR-06 | `changeQty` to exactly 0 | Item deleted from cart cleanly |
| ERR-07 | `checkout()` on empty cart | No dialog fired; no crash |
| ERR-08 | Double `checkout()` | Second call is no-op; cart stays empty |
| ERR-09 | Add all 10 → remove all 10 | Total = $0.00; no NaN anywhere |
| ERR-10 | Same product added 50× | Quantity = 50; total = unit price × 50; no Infinity |
| ERR-11 | 4× `toggleCart()` (even count) | Cart ends closed; `aria-expanded="false"` |
| ERR-12 | Add → checkout → add again | Cart fully reusable after purchase |

> **Real bugs found:** `addToCart(unknownId)` previously crashed (undefined product lookup). `changeQty(unknownId, +1)` injected a `NaN` key into the cart total. Both are now guarded and tested.

---

#### 9. Visual Regression — `store-visual.spec.ts`
**Purpose:** Takes pixel-level screenshots and diffs them against committed baseline PNGs (2% tolerance). Catches unintended UI changes — CSS regressions, layout shifts, broken states — that assertion tests cannot see.

| Test | What is screenshotted |
|---|---|
| VR-01 `@smoke` | Full page — product grid in default state |
| VR-02 | Header with cart button (0 items) |
| VR-03 | Single product card (name, price, button) |
| VR-04 | Add-to-Cart button in "Added!" (green) state |
| VR-05 | Cart sidebar — empty state |
| VR-06 | Cart sidebar — 3 items with quantities |
| VR-07 | Cart total section with Checkout button enabled |
| VR-08 | Toast notification displayed |
| VR-09 | Cart count badge showing 5 items |
| VR-10 | Quantity controls (−, qty, + buttons) |
| VR-11 | Remove (🗑) button inside cart item |
| VR-12 | Qty control for an item with qty = 3 |
| VR-13 | Full page on mobile viewport (375px) |
| VR-14 | Cart sidebar open on mobile viewport |

Baselines are stored in `tests/e2e/__snapshots__/store-visual.spec.ts/` and committed to git. Regenerate after intentional UI changes:

```bash
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts \
  tests/e2e/store-visual.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

### Load testing the store with k6

Requires store.html to be served over HTTP — start a local server first:

```bash
npx serve . -l 3000        # or: python3 -m http.server 3000

k6 run tests/load/store.k6.js                             # smoke:  2 VUs / 20s
k6 run --env SCENARIO=steady tests/load/store.k6.js       # steady: 20 VUs / 60s hold
k6 run --env SCENARIO=spike  tests/load/store.k6.js       # spike:  burst to 50 VUs
k6 run --env SCENARIO=stress tests/load/store.k6.js       # stress: ramp to 100 VUs
k6 run --env BASE_URL=http://myserver tests/load/store.k6.js
```

## Agent Architecture

Every agent hand-off is a typed **Pydantic model** in `contracts/schemas.py` — the single source of truth. Agents never import each other's internals.

### Pipeline stages

| # | Agent | LLM? | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `IngestorAgent` | No | GitHub REST API → normalise issue, infer priority/type from labels (rule-based) |
| 2 | `TestDesignerAgent` | Yes | Apply formal test-design: EP, BVA, Decision Table, Pairwise, Error Guessing |
| 2b | `StrategistAgent` | Yes | Alternative planner — risk-based scenario selection (default without `--sdet`) |
| 3 | `GeneratorAgent` | Yes | `TestPlan → GeneratedSuite`; accepts `reviewer_feedback` on revision pass |
| 3.5 | `ReviewerAgent` | Yes | 8-dimension audit; `verdict: ship \| revise \| reject`; feeds `top_3_fixes` back |
| 4 | `RunnerAgent` | No | Playwright CLI + multi-project config generation (Desktop/Mobile/Tablet) |
| 4.5 | `HealerAgent` | Selective | Classifies failures; LLM called only for `LOCATOR` to repair selectors |
| 5 | `ReporterAgent` | Yes | Narrative summary; gate is pure rule-based code — LLM never decides |

### Failure classification

`classify_failure()` in `agents/healer.py` is deterministic, rule-based, and ordering-critical:

```
ASSERTION   first — "expect(locator...)" messages contain "locator"; never heal these
ENVIRONMENT before TIMEOUT — ECONNREFUSED/OOM/browser-crash also say "timeout" but are infra
LOCATOR     — selector drifted; healable by the LLM
TIMEOUT     — pure wait exhaustion; retry candidate
FLAKY       — passed on retry; detected via classify_flaky(passed, retries > 0)
OTHER       — inspect full log
```

### Iterative critic refinement loop

```
Generator ──▶ Reviewer
                │
          verdict == "revise" or "reject"?
                │  yes
                ▼
          Generator (top_3_fixes injected as REVISION REQUIRED note)
                │
                ▼
          Reviewer (second pass — emitted for audit trail)
                │
                ▼
          Runner (suite always runs — verdict never gates execution)
```

`PipelineTrace.generation_passes` is `1` normally, `2` when a revision fired.

## Multi-Agent Council

A standalone 5-agent deliberation system for any open-ended question. Two debate rounds, a Safety Guard audit, then a synthesised final answer.

```
Question → Researcher → Creative → Critic (Round 1)
         → Researcher → Creative → Critic (Round 2 — responding to peers)
         → Safety Guard (audits all 6 statements)
         → Synthesizer (final unified answer)
```

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python council.py

# No API key:
python council.py --demo
```

## Key Design Constraints

These are enforced by code, not convention:

- **LLM never makes the gate decision.** `ReporterAgent._gate()` is pure Python. Any P0 failure or pass rate < 90% → `FAIL`. The narrative is LLM; the verdict is code.
- **Assertion failures are never healed.** `FailureKind.ASSERTION` is always `healable=False`. A failing `expect()` is a real bug, not a selector problem.
- **Contracts are the only shared interface.** Agents import only from `contracts/schemas.py`, never each other's internals.
- **Reviewer verdict is advisory.** It triggers a refinement pass but never blocks execution — the runner always runs.
- **Environment failures are not timeouts.** `ENVIRONMENT` is classified before `TIMEOUT` in `classify_failure()` — ordering is safety-critical.

A production-grade, multi-agent QA framework that takes a GitHub issue and delivers a complete, executed, self-healing Playwright test suite — with zero human intervention in between.

```
GitHub Issue ──▶ Ingestor ──▶ Test Designer ──▶ Generator ──▶ Reviewer ──▶ Runner ──▶ Healer ──▶ Reporter
                  (API)        (formal BVA/EP)    (LLM)       (LLM critic)  (PW CLI)   (LLM)      (rule gate)
```

## Features

| Capability | Details |
|---|---|
| **7-agent pipeline** | Ingestor → Test Designer → Generator → Reviewer → Runner → Healer → Reporter |
| **Iterative critic loop** | Reviewer audits generated suite; if verdict is "revise/reject", Generator gets one refinement pass with `top_3_fixes` injected |
| **Self-healing locators** | Detects selector drift, repairs via LLM grounded in live DOM, re-runs patched test. Never heals assertion failures |
| **Richer failure classification** | `LOCATOR` · `ASSERTION` · `ENVIRONMENT` · `FLAKY` · `TIMEOUT` · `OTHER` — rule-based, auditable, no LLM |
| **Visual regression** | 14 `toHaveScreenshot()` tests with 2% pixel tolerance + committed PNG baselines |
| **Multi-browser** | Desktop Chrome · Desktop Firefox · Mobile Chrome (Pixel 7) · Mobile Safari (iPhone 14, CI only — requires macOS 14+ or Docker) |
| **Full test pyramid** | 9 suites: API, performance, CWV, security, accessibility, endurance, state/resilience, error/edge-cases, visual + k6 load |
| **Dynamic test prioritization** | `git diff` → grep pattern; cuts CI from ~8 min to < 2 min on minor changes |
| **MCP server** | Real stdio JSON-RPC server — register in Claude desktop to control the pipeline via natural language |
| **Rule-based gate** | `ReporterAgent._gate()`: any P0 fail or pass rate < 90% → FAIL. LLM writes the narrative, never makes the decision |

## What You Can Achieve

### 1. Zero-Touch QA from a GitHub Issue
Point it at any public repo and issue number — the pipeline ingests, plans, generates runnable Playwright tests, executes them, repairs broken selectors, and delivers a pass/fail gate with a written report. No human writes a single line of test code.

```bash
python -m orchestrator.pipeline facebook/react 28000 --token ghp_xxx --real
```

### 2. Formal Test Design at Scale
Switch `--sdet` on and the `TestDesignerAgent` applies Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, Decision Tables, Pairwise, and Error Guessing — derived automatically from acceptance criteria in seconds.

### 3. Self-Healing Test Maintenance
When the UI changes and a selector breaks, the `HealerAgent` detects it (locator failure, not assertion), consults the live DOM, asks Claude for a repaired selector, patches the file, and re-runs. The old→new selector and confidence score are logged for human audit. Broken builds due to CSS class renames or `data-testid` changes become automatic fixes.

### 4. Production-Grade Test Pyramid on a Live App
The math hub proves the framework works against a real deployed SPA — 196 E2E tests across 3 browsers, 19 HTTP/API contract tests, 16 performance tests (TTFB, in-browser widget timing), 17 security tests (no eval, XSS guards, storage leakage), 12 endurance loop tests (30-iteration accuracy drift, 50-click idempotency), 14 visual regression tests with pixel diff baselines, and a full k6 load test suite with 5 scenarios up to 200 VUs. The ShopNow store adds a second complete pyramid: 286 tests across 9 suites (API, CWV, performance, security, accessibility, endurance, state/resilience, error/edge-cases, visual) with 3 browser targets — including 12 negative-path tests that catch real bugs like unguarded unknown product IDs causing NaN totals.

### 5. CI That Gets Smarter on Each PR
The prioritization script reads the git diff and tells CI exactly which test groups are at risk — if you only touched `math-hub-perf.spec.ts`, only the performance suite runs. A full 600+ test run becomes a targeted 30-test run on minor changes, without ever skipping something that could actually break.

### 6. Control the Entire QA Pipeline via Natural Language
Register `mcp_server/server.py` in Claude desktop and say: *"Run the security tests on Mobile Chrome and explain any failures"* — the MCP tools execute Playwright, parse results, classify each failure with rationale and next action, and return structured JSON, all without leaving the chat.

### 7. PRD → Tests → Jira → Slack → GitHub PR (Full Enterprise Loop)
The `mcp_framework/` extends the core pipeline: ingest a PRD, generate and scaffold a Playwright project on disk, execute it, file Jira tickets for genuine failures, open a GitHub PR with the test code, and post a Slack notification with the gate result.

### 8. Multi-Agent Deliberation on Any Question
`council.py` is a standalone 5-agent debate system — independent of the QA pipeline. It is useful for any structured decision-making, risk analysis, or architectural review where you want multiple AI perspectives pressure-tested by a Safety Guard before converging on a synthesised answer.

## Math Hub Test Suite (CBSE Class 8)

A complete test pyramid against a live GitHub Pages SPA — all suites run in CI.

### Run all suites

```bash
# Full pyramid — Desktop Chrome + Mobile Chrome
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts

# Single suite
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts tests/e2e/math-hub-api.spec.ts

# Headed (browser window visible)
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts --headed
```

### Test pyramid

| Suite | File | Tests | What it validates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Golden E2E** | `math-hub.spec.golden.ts` | 98 × 3 browsers | All 16 chapters, MCQ engine, widgets, navigation |
| **API / HTTP** | `math-hub-api.spec.ts` | 19 | Status codes, HTTPS/HSTS, ETag caching, self-containment |
| **Performance** | `math-hub-perf.spec.ts` | 16 | TTFB < 3s, widget latency < 50ms (in-browser), DOM complexity |
| **Security** | `math-hub-security.spec.ts` | 17 | No eval(), textContent vs innerHTML, no storage leakage |
| **Endurance loops** | `math-hub-loop.spec.ts` | 12 | 30-iter accuracy, 50-click idempotency, 30× canvas redraw |
| **Visual regression** | `math-hub-visual.spec.ts` | 14 | Screenshot diff, canvas charts, MCQ states, mobile layout |
| **Load (k6)** | `tests/load/math-hub.k6.js` | — | CDN p95 < 27ms, 0% error, 50% ETag cache hit |

### Visual regression baselines

Baselines are committed in `tests/e2e/__snapshots__/`. To regenerate after intentional UI changes:

```bash
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts \
  tests/e2e/math-hub-visual.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

### Load testing with k6

```bash
k6 run tests/load/math-hub.k6.js                         # smoke:  5 VUs / 20s
k6 run --env SCENARIO=steady tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # steady: 50 VUs / 60s hold
k6 run --env SCENARIO=spike  tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # spike:  burst to 100 VUs
k6 run --env SCENARIO=stress tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # stress: ramp to 200 VUs
k6 run --env SCENARIO=soak   tests/load/math-hub.k6.js   # soak:   20 VUs / 10 min
```

### Dynamic test prioritization

Run only the tests at risk from your current diff — cuts CI time on minor PRs:

```bash
# Compute grep pattern from current diff and run
GREP=$(python scripts/prioritize_tests.py)
npx playwright test --config playwright.math-hub.config.ts --grep "$GREP"

# Full JSON report showing which rules fired and why
python scripts/prioritize_tests.py --json
```

---

## ShopNow Store Test Suite

A full test pyramid for the dark-mode e-commerce SPA (`store.html`) — applies all advanced QA techniques to a real interactive application with localStorage persistence, cart sidebar, quantity controls, checkout, and toast notifications.

### Run all store suites

```bash
# Recommended: full pipeline — runs all tests, generates HTML report, auto-commits results
./run-tests.sh

# Smoke tests only (fast, ~11s — @smoke-tagged tests across all suites)
./run-tests.sh --smoke

# Raw Playwright — full pyramid, Desktop Chrome + Desktop Firefox + Mobile Chrome
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts

# Single suite
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts tests/e2e/store-error.spec.ts

# Headed (browser window visible)
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts --headed
```

### Store test pyramid

286 tests across 9 suites, 3 browser targets (Desktop Chrome · Desktop Firefox · Mobile Chrome).
Mobile Safari (iPhone 14) runs in CI only — Playwright WebKit requires macOS 14+ or the CI Playwright Docker image.

| Suite | File | Tests | What it validates |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Contract / API** | `store-api.spec.ts` | 12 | PRODUCTS schema, testid completeness, localStorage interface, self-containment |
| **Performance** | `store-perf.spec.ts` | 10 | renderProducts < 50ms, addToCart < 25ms, DOM size, Navigation Timing |
| **Core Web Vitals** | `store-cwv.spec.ts` | 8 | FCP, DCL, CLS (interaction-only, no buffered replay), TBT, load event timing |
| **Security** | `store-security.spec.ts` | 12 | No eval(), localStorage hygiene, XSS guards, no external requests |
| **Accessibility** | `store-a11y.spec.ts` | 12 | WCAG 2.1 AA via axe-core, keyboard nav, ARIA states, live regions |
| **Endurance loops** | `store-loop.spec.ts` | 12 | 30-cycle add, 50-toggle CSS, full lifecycle × 3, total accuracy drift |
| **State & Resilience** | `store-network.spec.ts` | 8 | localStorage persistence across reloads, isolation between contexts, corrupted-data recovery |
| **Error / Edge Cases** | `store-error.spec.ts` | 12 | Invalid product IDs, boundary qty operations, double-checkout, cart reuse after purchase |
| **Visual regression** | `store-visual.spec.ts` | 14 | Header, product card, cart states, qty controls, mobile layout |
| **Load (k6)** | `tests/load/store.k6.js` | — | 4 scenarios (smoke/steady/spike/stress), p95 < 500ms, TTFB < 200ms |

### Visual regression baselines

Generate baselines on first run (requires `--update-snapshots`):

```bash
npx playwright test --config playwright.store.config.ts \
  tests/e2e/store-visual.spec.ts --update-snapshots
```

Subsequent runs diff against committed PNGs in `tests/e2e/__snapshots__/store-visual.spec.ts/`.

### Load testing the store with k6

Requires store.html to be served over HTTP — start a local server first:

```bash
npx serve . -l 3000        # or: python3 -m http.server 3000

k6 run tests/load/store.k6.js                             # smoke:  2 VUs / 20s
k6 run --env SCENARIO=steady tests/load/store.k6.js       # steady: 20 VUs / 60s hold
k6 run --env SCENARIO=spike  tests/load/store.k6.js       # spike:  burst to 50 VUs
k6 run --env SCENARIO=stress tests/load/store.k6.js       # stress: ramp to 100 VUs
k6 run --env BASE_URL=http://myserver tests/load/store.k6.js
```

## Agent Architecture

Every agent hand-off is a typed **Pydantic model** in `contracts/schemas.py` — the single source of truth. Agents never import each other's internals.

### Pipeline stages

| # | Agent | LLM? | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `IngestorAgent` | No | GitHub REST API → normalise issue, infer priority/type from labels (rule-based) |
| 2 | `TestDesignerAgent` | Yes | Apply formal test-design: EP, BVA, Decision Table, Pairwise, Error Guessing |
| 2b | `StrategistAgent` | Yes | Alternative planner — risk-based scenario selection (default without `--sdet`) |
| 3 | `GeneratorAgent` | Yes | `TestPlan → GeneratedSuite`; accepts `reviewer_feedback` on revision pass |
| 3.5 | `ReviewerAgent` | Yes | 8-dimension audit; `verdict: ship \| revise \| reject`; feeds `top_3_fixes` back |
| 4 | `RunnerAgent` | No | Playwright CLI + multi-project config generation (Desktop/Mobile/Tablet) |
| 4.5 | `HealerAgent` | Selective | Classifies failures; LLM called only for `LOCATOR` to repair selectors |
| 5 | `ReporterAgent` | Yes | Narrative summary; gate is pure rule-based code — LLM never decides |

### Failure classification

`classify_failure()` in `agents/healer.py` is deterministic, rule-based, and ordering-critical:

```
ASSERTION   first — "expect(locator...)" messages contain "locator"; never heal these
ENVIRONMENT before TIMEOUT — ECONNREFUSED/OOM/browser-crash also say "timeout" but are infra
LOCATOR     — selector drifted; healable by the LLM
TIMEOUT     — pure wait exhaustion; retry candidate
FLAKY       — passed on retry; detected via classify_flaky(passed, retries > 0)
OTHER       — inspect full log
```

### Iterative critic refinement loop

```
Generator ──▶ Reviewer
                │
          verdict == "revise" or "reject"?
                │  yes
                ▼
          Generator (top_3_fixes injected as REVISION REQUIRED note)
                │
                ▼
          Reviewer (second pass — emitted for audit trail)
                │
                ▼
          Runner (suite always runs — verdict never gates execution)
```

`PipelineTrace.generation_passes` is `1` normally, `2` when a revision fired.

## Key Design Constraints

These are enforced by code, not convention:

- **LLM never makes the gate decision.** `ReporterAgent._gate()` is pure Python. Any P0 failure or pass rate < 90% → `FAIL`. The narrative is LLM; the verdict is code.
- **Assertion failures are never healed.** `FailureKind.ASSERTION` is always `healable=False`. A failing `expect()` is a real bug, not a selector problem.
- **Contracts are the only shared interface.** Agents import only from `contracts/schemas.py`, never each other's internals.
- **Reviewer verdict is advisory.** It triggers a refinement pass but never blocks execution — the runner always runs.
- **Environment failures are not timeouts.** `ENVIRONMENT` is classified before `TIMEOUT` in `classify_failure()` — ordering is safety-critical.

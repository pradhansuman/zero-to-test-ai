# AI-Assisted QA Framework — 5-Agent Pipeline

From a real GitHub issue to a passing/failing Playwright test report — fully automated.

```
IssueRef ─▶ Ingestor ─▶ Planner ─▶ Generator ─▶ Runner ─▶ Healer ─▶ Reporter ─▶ ReportArtifact
           (GitHub)     (LLM)       (LLM)        (Playwright) (LLM)    (LLM+rules)
```

## Quick Start — Run It in 5 Minutes

### Step 1 — Prerequisites

Make sure these are installed on your machine:

| Tool | Check | Install |
|---|---|---|
| Python 3.10+ | `python3 --version` | [python.org](https://python.org) |
| Node.js 18+ | `node --version` | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) |
| Git | `git --version` | pre-installed on Mac/Linux |

---

### Step 2 — Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pradhansuman/qa-agent-pipeline.git
cd qa-agent-pipeline

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browsers (needed for real test runs only)
npm i -D @playwright/test allure-playwright
npx playwright install chromium
```

---

### Step 3 — Try It Instantly (No API Key Needed)

This runs the full 6-stage pipeline with zero internet and zero cost.
All LLM responses are pre-baked stubs — same code paths, same contracts:

```bash
python -m orchestrator.pipeline --demo --offline
```

**Expected output:**

```
  [ ingested] ok
  [  planned] ok
  [generated] ok
  [   tested] ok
  [   healed] ok
  [ reported] ok

Issue #1042: Login form allows empty email submission
Plan:  5 scenarios, risk=high
Run:   5/5 passed (100.0%)
Heal:  1 recovered by self-healing agent
         TC-002: [data-testid="submit-btn"] → [data-testid="login-submit"] (conf 0.93)
Gate:  PASS
```

If you see this output — everything is working. ✅

---

### Step 4 — Run Against a Real GitHub Issue (Needs API Key)

```bash
# Set your Anthropic API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# Pull a real public GitHub issue, plan + generate + simulate + report
python -m orchestrator.pipeline facebook/react 28000
```

**Optional: add a GitHub token to avoid rate limits**

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python -m orchestrator.pipeline facebook/react 28000 --token ghp_yourGitHubToken
```

Get a free GitHub token at: Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens → Generate (no scopes needed for public repos).

---

### Step 5 — Run Against a Real Website with Live Playwright

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python -m orchestrator.pipeline myorg/myapp 1042 --token ghp_xxx --real
```

The `--real` flag launches a real Chromium browser, executes the generated tests, and the HealerAgent repairs any broken selectors automatically.

---

### Step 6 — Try the 5-Agent Council (Bonus)

A separate deliberation system where 5 AI agents debate any question:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python council.py

# No API key? Use demo mode:
python council.py --demo
```

Type any question at the prompt. All 5 agents (Researcher, Creative, Critic, Safety Guard, Synthesizer) debate it across two rounds before giving a final answer.

---

### Common Errors & Fixes

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `ModuleNotFoundError: anthropic` | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set` | Run `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` |
| `npx playwright install` fails | Run `npm install` first, then retry |
| GitHub 403 / rate limit | Add `--token ghp_xxx` with a free GitHub token |
| `credit balance too low` | Add credits at console.anthropic.com |

---

Every arrow is a typed Pydantic contract (`contracts/schemas.py`). Agents
share nothing but these models, so any stage can be mocked, swapped, or re-run
in isolation.

---

## The six agents

| # | Agent | LLM? | Input → Output | Responsibility |
|---|-------|------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | `IngestorAgent` | No | `IssueRef → IssuePayload` | Hit the GitHub REST API, normalise the issue, infer priority/type/component from labels (rule-based, auditable). |
| 2 | `PlannerAgent` | Yes | `IssuePayload → TestPlan` | Decide *what* to test. 3–6 prioritised scenarios with concrete steps. Escalates priority independently of the issue label. |
| 3 | `GeneratorAgent` | Yes | `TestPlan → GeneratedSuite` | Decide *how* to test. Emit runnable Playwright + TypeScript with Allure annotations. Security-guarded prompt. |
| 4 | `RunnerAgent` | No | `GeneratedSuite → RunResults` | Execute via the Playwright CLI, parse the JSON reporter, roll up pass/fail. `real=False` gives a deterministic simulation for demos. |
| 4.5 | `HealerAgent` | Yes | `RunResults → RunResults + log` | Triage each failure; repair stale **selectors** grounded in the live DOM, patch the file, re-run that one test. Never touches assertion failures. |
| 5 | `ReporterAgent` | Yes | `RunResults → ReportArtifact` | Write the PR-reviewer narrative. The **merge-gate decision is rule-based**, never left to model phrasing. |

### How self-healing works (and what it refuses to do)

The `HealerAgent` runs only when there are failures, and only acts on
**locator** failures — a selector that no longer matches the DOM because the UI
changed. For each one it:

1. classifies the failure (rule-based: locator / assertion / timeout / other),
2. pulls the broken selector and a snapshot of the **current DOM**,
3. asks Claude for a repaired selector *grounded in what actually exists*,
4. patches the test file and re-runs that single test,
5. logs the `old → new` selector, rationale, and confidence.

Three guardrails make this safe to put in CI:

- **Assertion failures are never healed.** A failing `expect()` means the code
  is wrong or the spec changed — silently "fixing" it would hide a real bug.
  The Healer marks it `healable=False`, leaves it red, and never even calls the
  LLM (verified by test).
- **A heal only counts if the re-run passes.** A repaired selector that still
  fails stays failed.
- **Nothing is rewritten invisibly.** Every heal is in `self_healing_log` with
  full before/after, so a reviewer can audit exactly what the agent changed.

### Why two agents don't use the LLM

Ingestion and execution must be **ground truth**. We never want a model to
invent an issue number or soften a failing test. The LLM is used only where
judgement adds value: deciding what to test, writing the test code, and
explaining the results.

### Why the gate is rule-based

`ReporterAgent._gate()` blocks merge if **any P0 fails** or the pass rate drops
below 90%. The LLM writes the human summary around that decision but cannot
override it — a hallucinated "looks good!" can never merge a broken build.

## Agent prompts & contracts at a glance

Each agent file is self-documenting: the module docstring states the I/O
contract, and the `SYSTEM` constant is the full prompt. Read them in order:

1. `agents/ingestor.py`  — no prompt; GitHub API + label inference
2. `agents/planner.py`   — "decide WHAT to test, never write code"
3. `agents/generator.py` — "convert plan to Playwright TS, never weaken security"
4. `agents/runner.py`    — no prompt; Playwright CLI + JSON parse
5. `agents/reporter.py`  — "write the PR summary"; gate lives in code

---

## Run it

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# pull a real public issue, plan + generate + simulate + heal + report
python -m orchestrator.pipeline facebook/react 28000

# with a GitHub token (private repos / rate limits) and a real Playwright run
python -m orchestrator.pipeline myorg/app 1042 --token ghp_xxx --real
```

### Offline demo mode (no API key, no credit)

Every LLM agent can be stubbed with canned, in-repo responses so the whole
six-stage pipeline runs with no Anthropic key, no credit, and (with `--offline`)
no internet. Same code paths, same contracts, same self-heal cycle — only the
model's judgement is pre-baked. Ideal for live demos and CI smoke tests.

```bash
# full pipeline, canned LLM output, still pulls the real GitHub issue
python -m orchestrator.pipeline demo/app 1042 --demo

# fully offline — also stubs the GitHub issue
python -m orchestrator.pipeline --demo --offline
```

Expected offline output:

```
  [ ingested] ok
  [  planned] ok
  [generated] ok
  [   tested] ok
  [   healed] ok
  [ reported] ok

Issue #1042: Login form allows empty email submission
Plan: 5 scenarios, risk=high
Run:  5/5 passed (100.0%)
Heal: 1 recovered by self-healing agent
        TC-002: [data-testid="submit-btn"] -> [data-testid="login-submit"] (conf 0.93)
Gate: PASS
```

---

## Deploy to CI

`.github/workflows/qa-pipeline.yml` triggers when an issue is labelled
`qa-ready`. Each agent is a job; the Planner's output flows to the Generator
via job outputs; the Runner job runs inside the official Playwright Docker
image; the Reporter posts its `issue_comment` back on the issue and the gate
decision sets the job's exit status.

```
issues: [labeled qa-ready]
  └─ plan ─▶ generate ─▶ test (Docker) ─▶ report ─▶ comment + gate
```

See `Dockerfile` for the test container and the workflow file for the wiring.

## Multi-Agent Council (`council.py`)

A standalone 5-agent deliberation system. Any question is debated across two rounds before a final answer is synthesised.

```
User question
  → Researcher  (Round 1 — facts)
  → Creative    (Round 1 — novel angles)
  → Critic      (Round 1 — challenges assumptions)
  → Researcher  (Round 2 — responds to peers)
  → Creative    (Round 2 — responds to peers)
  → Critic      (Round 2 — responds to peers)
  → Safety Guard (audits all 6 statements)
  → Synthesizer  (final unified answer)
```

```bash
# Live — real Claude API calls
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
python council.py

# Demo — no API key required, shows the full flow with sample responses
python council.py --demo
```

STAGE 4.5 — Self-Healing Agent.

Sits between the Runner and the Reporter. For each FAILED test it triages the
failure, and only if the failure is a *locator* problem (selector no longer
matches the DOM) does it attempt a repair:

    1. classify the failure  (locator | assertion | timeout | other)
    2. if locator: pull the broken selector + a DOM snapshot
    3. ask Claude for a repaired selector GROUNDED in the actual DOM
    4. patch the test file (old selector -> new selector)
    5. re-run just that one test
    6. record the before -> after as a HealingAttempt

I/O CONTRACT
    in : RunResults  (+ access to the GeneratedSuite files + a DOM provider)
    out: (RunResults, list[HealingAttempt])   — updated results + audit log

DESIGN GUARDRAILS
  • Assertion failures are NEVER healed. A failing assertion means the code is
    wrong or the spec changed — silently "fixing" it would hide a real bug.
    The Healer marks it healable=False and leaves it red.
  • Every heal is logged with the old selector, new selector, rationale, and
    confidence. Nothing is rewritten invisibly.
  • A heal only "counts" if the re-run actually passes. A repaired selector
    that still fails stays failed.

    Rule-based triage — deterministic, no LLM. Cheap and auditable.

    ORDERING IS CRITICAL:
    1. Assertion FIRST — many assertion messages contain "locator". If locator
       were checked first, a real bug would be silently "healed", hiding the
       regression. NEVER reorder assertion below locator.
    2. Environment — infra failures (browser crash, OOM, network reset, Docker).
       Must come before Timeout because environment errors often surface with
       "timeout" in the message but the root cause is infra, not test logic.
    3. Locator — selector drifted / element not found / 0 elements matched.
       "Timeout waiting for selector" belongs here: selector is the root cause.
    4. Flaky — test passed on a Playwright retry (retries > 0 in the result).
       Detected separately in the runner by checking retry count, not from error.
    5. Timeout — pure wait exhaustion not caused by a missing selector or infra.

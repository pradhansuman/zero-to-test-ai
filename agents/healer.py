STAGE 4.5 — Self-Healing Agent.

Sits between the Runner and the Reporter. For each FAILED test it triages the
failure, and only if the failure is a *locator* problem (selector no longer
matches the DOM) does it attempt a repair:

    1. classify the failure  (locator | assertion | timeout | other)
    2. if locator: pull the broken selector + a DOM snapshot
    3. ask Claude for a repaired selector GROUNDED in the actual DOM
    4. patch the test file (old selector -> new selector)
    5. re-run just that one test
    6. record the before -> after as a HealingAttempt

I/O CONTRACT
    in : RunResults  (+ access to the GeneratedSuite files + a DOM provider)
    out: (RunResults, list[HealingAttempt])   — updated results + audit log

DESIGN GUARDRAILS
  • Assertion failures are NEVER healed. A failing assertion means the code is
    wrong or the spec changed — silently "fixing" it would hide a real bug.
    The Healer marks it healable=False and leaves it red.
  • Every heal is logged with the old selector, new selector, rationale, and
    confidence. Nothing is rewritten invisibly.
  • A heal only "counts" if the re-run actually passes. A repaired selector
    that still fails stays failed.

    Rule-based triage — deterministic, no LLM. Cheap and auditable.

    ORDERING IS CRITICAL:
    1. Assertion FIRST — many assertion messages contain the word "locator"
       (e.g. "expect(locator('x')).toHaveText('hello')"). If locator were
       checked first, a genuine bug would be silently "healed" by the Healer,
       hiding the regression from engineers. NEVER reorder assertion below locator.
    2. Locator — element not found / not visible / selector drifted.

A Playwright test failed because a selector no longer matches the DOM (the UI
changed — a data-testid was renamed, an element moved, a class changed).

You are given: the broken selector and a snapshot of the CURRENT DOM. Find the
element the test almost certainly intended to target and return a repaired,
ROBUST selector grounded in what actually exists in the DOM.

Rules:
- Prefer a data-testid if one exists on the intended element; else a stable
  role+name; else a stable attribute. Never invent a selector not supported by
  the DOM snapshot.
- Prefer resilience: a selector unlikely to break again on minor UI changes.
- If the intended element genuinely no longer exists in the DOM, set confidence
  below 0.4 and explain — do not fabricate a match.
